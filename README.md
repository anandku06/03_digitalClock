# Digital Clock  

A simple **Digital Clock** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases real-time clock functionality while practicing DOM manipulation in JavaScript.  

## Features  
- Displays the current time in `HH:MM:SS` format.  
- Updates every second in real-time.  
- Responsive design with customizable styles using CSS.  

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML**: Structure of the clock.  
- **CSS**: Styling for an appealing look.  
- **JavaScript**: Logic for time updates and DOM manipulation.  

## Project Structure  
```plaintext
📁 Project Folder  
├── 📄 index.html  # Main HTML file  
├── 📄 style.css   # CSS for styling  
└── 📄 script.js   # JavaScript for functionality  
```

## How to Run  
1. Clone or download the project repository.  
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.  
3. The digital clock will start running, displaying the current time.  

## Customization  
- Modify the `style.css` file to change the clock's appearance (e.g., colors, fonts, layout).  
- Enhance functionality by adding a date display or toggling between 12-hour and 24-hour formats.  

## Learning Outcomes  
- Gained hands-on experience with DOM manipulation.  
- Improved understanding of real-time updates in web development.  
- Practiced integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a project.  

## Future Improvements
